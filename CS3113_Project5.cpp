// This project acts us to calculate the sum of an INT array using threads that re in a binary tree 
// For input we get the height of the tree
// The size of the array (numbers of input elements)
// The ints themselve
// Need to calculate the number of leaf nodes 
// detemine if we can divide by the tree height
// IF NOT: Pad 0's to make it so we can do this division
// with this value we can pass off N sized sub arrays to the threads
